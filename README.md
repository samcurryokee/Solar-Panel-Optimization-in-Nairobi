# Problem Statement
There is a lack of a systematic approach for harnessing the solar potential of individual buildings in Nairobi. This is exacerbated by multiple unprojected power outages from KPLC, leading to increased interest in alternative energy sources. The primary issues include an absence of precise insights into suitable areas for solar installations and the lack of leveraging a vector dataset containing building footprints in Nairobi.

# Objectives

1. **Rooftop Solar Potential Prediction:**
    - Utilize machine learning techniques to predict suitable rooftop areas, installable capacity, and estimated yearly energy potential for each building unit.
    - Incorporate features such as building type, estimated tilt, and building height in the predictive models.


2. **Optimization Strategies:**
   - Implement algorithms to identify the most efficient rooftop solar installations.
   - Develop strategies for maximizing solar potential while respecting building characteristics.
   - Conduct a basic cost-benefit analysis considering unit installation prices to determine the economic viability of rooftop solar installations for different building types.

3. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to interact with the system.
   - Enable users to input building characteristics and receive real-time recommendations for optimal rooftop solar installations.
